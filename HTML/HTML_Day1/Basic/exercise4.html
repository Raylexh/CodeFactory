  <h1>Bad Boys</h1>
  
  <p>
    <span>Miami-Dade detectives Mike Lowrey (Will Smith) and</span><br> 
    <span>Marcus Burnett (Martin Lawrence) blow a fuse when $100</span><br> 
    <span>million worth of heroin they recently confiscated is heisted</span><br> 
    <span>from station headquarters. Suspecting it was an inside job,</span><br> 
    <span>Internal Affairs gives them five days to track down the</span><br> 
    <span>drugs before they shut down the narcotics division. Action</span><br> 
    <span>meets farce when Marcus is compelled to masquerade as</span><br> 
    <span>his partner in order to gain the trust of a call girl (Tea</span><br> 
    <span>Leoni), a key witness in their investigation</span>
